Step 1: Create Post and Comment Models

    Model Definitions:
        In a new app within the project called posts, create models for Post and Comment.
        Post should have fields like author (ForeignKey to User), title, content, created_at, and updated_at.
        Comment should reference both Post (ForeignKey) and User (author), with additional fields for content, created_at, and updated_at.

    Database Setup:
        Include these models in your migrations and update the database by running: bash python manage.py makemigrations posts python manage.py migrate

Step 2: Implement Serializers for Posts and Comments

    Serializer Setup:
        Create serializers for both Post and Comment in posts/serializers.py.
        Ensure that serializers handle user relationships correctly and validate data as needed.

Step 3: Create Views for CRUD Operations

    View Implementation:
        Using Django REST Framework’s viewsets, set up CRUD operations for both posts and comments in posts/views.py.
        Implement permissions to ensure users can only edit or delete their own posts and comments.

Step 4: Configure URL Routing

    Routing Configuration:
        Define URL patterns in posts/urls.py that map to the viewsets using Django REST Framework’s routers. This includes routes for listing, creating, editing, and deleting both posts and comments.

Step 5: Implement Pagination and Filtering

    Enhance API Usability:
        Add pagination to post and comment list endpoints to manage large datasets.
        Implement filtering capabilities in post views to allow users to search posts by title or content.

Step 6: Test and Validate Functionality

    Testing Guidelines:
        Thoroughly test all endpoints using tools like Postman or automated tests to ensure they behave as expected.
        Validate that permissions are correctly enforced and that data integrity is maintained through the API.

Step 7: Document API Endpoints

    Documentation:
        Update the API documentation to include detailed information on how to interact with the posts and comments endpoints.
        Provide examples of requests and responses for all operations.


    API Documentation: Detailed descriptions of each endpoint, including usage examples.
    Testing Results: Evidence of testing and validation, including any scripts or Postman collections used.
